# Description of the MSc Project: Personality Test as Choice Making IF

## Intro
Inspired by famously Choice IF book [Choose Your Own Adventure]. 

This project is about creating a choice IF (interactive Fiction) game to assess users' personality by giving them all the same adventure and record the choices they make to accurately give personality result that match their own.

the adventure story here is entirely hand-crafted from the [ Test Your Personality ] by Adrian Wallwork.

I took two tests that governs the general traits, namely Introvert vs Extrovert and Optimist vs Pessimist totalled 20 questionnaires tailored as one full adventure.

## Gameplay
The user would need to have understand the forewarning at the beginning of the program, that they are to answer truthfully for accurate assessment

then will be prompted to give their name, and begins the game.

For each point of story, they will be given choices to choose, there is no true or false merely plot story affection. Each choice simply give small change akin to butterfly effect to the entire adventure.

For every choice they made, will be recorded by program to count toward the scale how closer they are to certain personality. The end result will be given at the end of adventure.
